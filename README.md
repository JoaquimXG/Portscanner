# Portscanner in Python 

This project is mostly an exercise to improve my own understanding of how portscanners such as nmap operate.  

The end goal is to create a script that can do both host discovery and port scanning using a number of different contemporary methods. 
## Usage 

This will be written entirely in Python3 and usage can be shown using --help.

## Dependancies

Currently only Linux is supported
Scapy (2.4.3 tested)

## To-Do

### Port scanning 

Connection scan,
SYN scan,
ACK scan,
UDP scan,
FIN, NULL, XMAS scans,

### Misc

Add support for windows
