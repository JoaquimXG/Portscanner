# Portscanner in Python 

![Over the Wire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/)

This project is mostly an exercise to improve my own understanding of how portscanners such as nmap operate.  

The end goal is to create a script that can do both host discovery and port scanning using a number of different contemporary methods. 
## Usage 

This will be written entirely in Python3 and usage can be shown using --help.

## To-Do

### Host Discovery

SYN ping scan
ACK ping scan
ICMP echo,timestamp and mask ping scans
ARP ping scan

### Port scanning 

Connection scan
SYN scan
ACK scan
UDP scan
FIN, NULL, XMAS scans
